# Img-to-ASCII-Art
This project is a Python-based tool that converts images into ASCII art. ASCII art represents images using text characters, providing a unique way to display visual content without relying on pixels. This tool allows you to select an image file, converts it to grayscale, resizes it, and generates ASCII art based on the image's pixel data. The resulting ASCII art is saved as a .txt file.

About the Project
The "Image to ASCII Art" tool converts an image into ASCII art by transforming the pixel data of an image into text characters. This project is useful for creating visual content that can be easily shared in text-based formats like emails or command-line interfaces.
